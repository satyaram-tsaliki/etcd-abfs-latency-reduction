# üìö ETCD Notification Latency Reduction Using Approximate Breadth First Search (ABFS) Graph Algorithm

## üìù Abstract

This research introduces an optimized implementation of **ETCD‚Äôs watch mechanism**, employing an **Approximate Breadth-First Search (ABFS)** graph algorithm to **reduce notification latency** in distributed systems. Traditional Levelized Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms used in ETCD‚Äôs watch mechanism suffer from high latency as the system scales. The proposed **ABFS algorithm**, developed in **Go**, leverages probabilistic traversal strategies to minimize computational overhead, reduce graph traversal time, and improve event notification efficiency.  
Experimental analysis was performed on **ETCD clusters** of varying sizes (16GB to 64GB), with significant improvements in **notification latency**, **throughput**, **CPU usage**, and **memory consumption** compared to the existing BFS-based watch mechanism.
